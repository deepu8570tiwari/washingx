                                        have been damaged by Washing Xpress will be reimbursed in accordance with the
                                        International Fabricare Fair Claims Guide and shall not exceed ten (10) times
                                        our charge for processing that garment regardless of brand or condition. Eg: If
                                        the total bill amount for laundering 5 garments was Rs. 500, the maximum
                                        reimbursement per lost/ damaged garment shall be = 500/5 x 10 Times = Rs. 1,000.
                                        Any reimbursement of INR 500 or below shall be directly credited only to the
                                        account. Cleaning and drying laundry also creates other risks. We do not
                                        individually examine every garment prior to placing it in the regular laundry
                                        process. Therefore, if something is "dry-clean only," or otherwise unsuitable
                                        for common washing and drying techniques, please do not include it in the
                                        regular laundry you give to us. We wash all items together as our standard
                                        procedure. But if you divide your clothes into two separate bags before your
                                        pick-up, we can run two separate loads. This incurs a Separate Load Charge as
                                        per our pricing. Note that we do not separate clothes according to your
                                        instruction, and ask that you do the separation and take responsibility for
                                        what's in each load. Along the same lines, we can't be held responsible for the
                                        re-disposition of colors (aka bleeding) or dimensional changes (aka shrinking or
                                        stretching).

                                    <p class="mb-0">5.3 Lost Items
                                        The customer must notify Washing Xpress within 24 hours of receipt of a delivery
                                        of any lost items from that particular delivery; failure to do so constitutes
                                        waiver of a claim for any lost items from that delivery. Washing Xpress makes
                                        its best reasonable effort to track every item that we process and will review
                                        all lost items claims on a case by case basis. Washing Xpress is not responsible
                                        for your items before we pick them up and after we drop them off. It is your
                                        responsibility to ensure the safety of your items during these times.
                                        We would love to be able to inventory every piece of laundry you give us.
                                        Unfortunately, it is cost-prohibitive for us to do so. As a result we can't be
                                        held responsible for any lost laundry; we simply have no efficient way of
                                        verifying that we actually received any particular piece of laundry in the first
                                        place.
                                        Rest assured though, we carefully track your clothes. For instance, we tag all
                                        our bundles with your name, and your clothes are never loose in our facility
                                        unless they’re inside a machine, on the folding table, or in their own laundry
                                        cart waiting to be folded.
                                        If you do believe you are missing something from your delivery, please notify us
                                        within 24 hours of receiving your clean clothes — we are much more likely to
                                        find misplaced laundry if it is reported early. Failure to notify within 24
                                        hours of receiving your clean clothes constitutes waiver of any claim for any
                                        lost items from that delivery.

                                        Washing Xpress will inventory all dry cleaning items once they arrive at the
                                        facility to be cleaned. This inventory is final, and we will track your items
                                        carefully to return them to you. However, any items determined to have been lost
                                        by Washing Xpress will be reimbursed in accordance with the International
                                        Fabricare Fair Claims Guide and shall not exceed ten (10) times our charge for
                                        cleaning that garment regardless of brand or condition. Washing Xpress is not
                                        responsible for your items before we pick them up and after we drop them off. It
                                        is your responsibility to ensure the safety of your items during these times.
                                        Should you find an issue with one of your pieces, please notify us within 24
                                        hours of your delivery.
                                        As with our standard laundry process, Washing Xpress cannot be responsible for
                                        wear and tear resulting from cleaning, for very delicate items such as buttons
                                        or sequins, or for clothing missing proper care labels.
                                        "Extras" will be charged at the discretion of the dry cleaner, in order to
                                        process your garment the best way possible, in increments of Rs. 100 – Rs. 500
                                        upon delivery to the laundry facility. These charges will be added to your final
                                        invoice. Items such as leather require longer turnaround times and could take up
                                        to two weeks to be returned.

                                        or our Android App or Our iOS App. If you no longer want our service, simply let

                                        Cancelled and Refunds Policy. Although we truly hope you are satisfied with our
                                        services, once we have laundered your clothes, we cannot offer a refund.
                                        To make life simpler, we round to the nearest Kg. when weighing your laundry.
                                        The weight as measured by Washing Xpress shall be final and binding on the
                                        customer and the final invoice shall be raised based on the weight as measured
                                        by Washing Xpress. Of course we don't anticipate having any problems with our
                                        customers refusing to pay, but just in case, we reserve the right to hold your
                                        laundry hostage until we are paid in full.

                                        Service days and turnaround time may vary by location or overload of work or any
                                        other special occasions. Washing Xpress will make its best reasonable effort to

                                        We will do our best to pick-up your laundry at the agreed upon time. We know
                                        that we won't have very many customers if we are late. That being said, we can't
                                        be held accountable if we are late for unforeseen circumstances. Similarly, we
                                        hope that you will strive to be on-time for our deliveries. If you do miss a
                                        pick-up or delivery, we will try to coordinate an alternate time as soon as
                                        possible.
                                        To prevent laundry errors, all services must be tied to an appointment. If we

                                        that you would like to be picked up, please schedule an additional pickup online
                                        or notify Customer Care at least 2 hours before your scheduled service.
                                        A No Show is when we show up to your door, but you and your laundry aren't
                                        around. In the case of a No Show, we reserve the right to charge a Rs.50
                                        Logistic Fee. Keep in mind, there's no fee if you cancel or reschedule more than
